Funjs
=====

## Introduction

funjs is a tool set for functional programming fans and other people who 
want to have a taste of programming paradigm other than OOP.
Currently the project is just one of my spare time interest, 
so it will be continuously under development. 
The key feature should include but not limit to: 

* lazy calculation of iterators
* curry functions
